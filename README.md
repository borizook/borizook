- 👋 Hey there! I'm Jun-Sik.

- 🔬 Infectious diseases, surveillance, and One Health are my jam! 🌍

- 🌱 Currently delving into the world of African swine fever in wild boar populations, armed with mechanistic and spatial modeling.

- 🚀 Additionally, I aspire to extend my expertise into the realms of phylodynamics and causal inference.

- 🚧 Hang tight, my GitHub is undergoing a glow-up. Exciting things in the pipeline!
